        This is something we should have talked about earlier, but it's fine, I'm going to say it today. It's about the life you'll have if, somehow, you lose me (I'm talking about death). See, I know you don't like to talk about this topic, but it's something really important, and this message will convey everything. You just have to read the whole thing. <br><br>

        If there comes a day when you no longer receive a good morning text from me for the rest of your life, you don't have to feel bad, because I always want to see you happy. Even things get back to normal after a few days, months or maybe year, you might miss me occasionally or maybe every day. You might get some tears in your eyes thinking of me and my stupidity :) But I want you to smile always whenever you miss me because that's the face of yours I love the most. <br><br>

        I want you to achieve everything in your life that you ever dreamed of and make everyone proud, including me :) It's true that you‚Äôll get back to normal in some time. You won‚Äôt miss me the same way you did in the beginning. There will be days when you‚Äôll miss me a lot, but there will also be days when you‚Äôll be busy with life. Death is the most unpredictable thing we never know when we‚Äôll have our last goodbye. But at least with this message, I can tell you my feelings if something like this happens. <br><br>

        I always love you so much, Muskan. You are the best best best person I could ever have in my life, and all I want is to see you happy always. You promise me that you‚Äôll always stay happy and not miss me too much. You always wanted someone who could understand you without even saying anything, someone you could share everything with. I always wanted to be that someone for you, and I wasn‚Äôt that someone for you the last time you mentioned this. So I hope that you may find someone and always stay happy. <br><br>

        This might sound selfish, but I don‚Äôt want you to fall in love with someone else. But even if you do (I know you won‚Äôt), don‚Äôt love them as much as you love me :) I‚Äôm always with you. Whenever you close your eyes, you‚Äôll see my ugly face with a stupid smile staring at you. A love story ends when both lovers are no longer in this world, but as long as one of us is here, our love story is alive. <br><br>

        I want you to stay strong always. I‚Äôll miss hearing ‚ÄúHow was your day?‚Äù from you, but this is the reality we can‚Äôt deny. I really want to cry in your arms right now. I want to hug you tight and tell you that I‚Äôm not going anywhere. We‚Äôll spend a lot of time together, and this message is just for the unexpected. We‚Äôre all good and fine. Aise hi thodi peecha chhod denge aapka. I love every every every single second with you Muskan.. whatever I said same goes for me as well, but for me I would never overcome such a huge loss of mine, It's same for you as well.. we both love each other unconditionally, it's true and also the most beautiful thing about our relationship.. <br><br>

        We are small(not that much tho but still we are small) and managing to have a healthy relationship, efforts are from both the sides.. and we should always be proud of our relationship, I hope I'm a good boyfriend and a boy you always wanted, cause you are everything I ever dreamed of, and I hope I have the qualities that you might dreamed for love of your life.. If someday I dissapear, Remember one thing I'm always with you.. Just close your eyes and I'll be there :) <br>

        Happy 3 Years ü§©
